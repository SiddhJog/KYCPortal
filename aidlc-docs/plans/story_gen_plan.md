# KYC Portal for Auto Loan Origination - Story Generation Plan

## Plan Overview
This document outlines the steps to analyze the requirements document, define user personas and roles, create user stories, organize them into units of work, and identify dependencies between these units.

## Plan Steps

### 1. Requirements Analysis
- [ ] Read and understand the requirements document thoroughly
- [ ] Identify key functional areas from the requirements
- [ ] Identify key user interactions with the system
- [ ] Extract system roles from the requirements
- [ ] Map requirements to potential user needs
- [ ] Clarification needed: Are there any specific business priorities among the requirements that should influence the user stories? [Answer]: yes get the app working comaprison can happen in phase 2.
- [ ] Focus on core functionality first, with document comparison features planned for phase 2

### 2. Define User Personas and Roles
- [ ] Identify primary user roles (customers, staff, administrators, etc.)
- [ ] Create detailed personas for each role with:
  - [ ] Demographics
  - [ ] Goals and motivations
  - [ ] Pain points and challenges
  - [ ] Technical proficiency
  - [ ] Usage patterns
- [ ] Document personas in personas.md
- [ ] Clarification needed: Are there any specific user demographics or characteristics that should be emphasized in the personas? [Answer]: no

### 3. Create User Stories
- [ ] Draft user stories for each functional requirement using the format: "As a [persona], I want to [action] so that [benefit]"

  - [ ] Testable
- [ ] Add acceptance criteria to each user story
- [ ] Assign unique identifiers to each user story
- [ ] Prioritize user stories using the MoSCoW method (Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)
- [ ] Document all user stories in stories.md
- [ ] Clarification needed: Should user stories be prioritized (e.g., MoSCoW method: Must have, Should have, Could have, Won't have)? [Answer]: yes

### 4. Define Units of Work
- [ ] Group related user stories into logical units of work
- [ ] Ensure each unit of work:
  - [ ] Has a clear objective
  - [ ] Represents a cohesive piece of functionality
  - [ ] Can be developed and tested as a unit
  - [ ] Delivers value to users
- [ ] Design units of work to be as independent as possible
- [ ] Assign unique identifiers to each unit of work
- [ ] Document units of work in units_of_work.md
- [ ] Clarification needed: What is the preferred size/scope for a unit of work (e.g., sprint duration, team capacity)? [Answer]: group related stories. so that a UoW can be done more or less independently.

### 5. Identify Dependencies
- [ ] Analyze dependencies between units of work
- [ ] Identify:
  - [ ] Technical dependencies
  - [ ] Functional dependencies
  - [ ] External dependencies (including SSO integration)
- [ ] List technical, functional and external dependencies.
- [ ] Create a dependency matrix showing relationships between units of work
- [ ] Visualize dependencies in a clear format
- [ ] Document dependencies in dependency_analysis.md
- [ ] Clarification needed: Are there any known external system dependencies or integration points that should be considered? [Answer]: SSO

### 6. Review and Finalization
- [ ] Review all artifacts for consistency
- [ ] Ensure traceability between requirements, user stories, and units of work
- [ ] Verify that all requirements are covered by user stories
- [ ] Check that dependencies are accurately captured
- [ ] Prepare final versions of all documents
- [ ] Prepare materials for your review
- [ ] Validate the artifacts against the requirements document to ensure all requirements are covered.
- [ ] Clarification needed: Who should be involved in the review process? [Answer]: me

Once this plan is approved, I will proceed with creating the user personas, user stories, units of work, and dependency analysis based on the approved plan and any clarifications provided.
