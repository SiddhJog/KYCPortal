# KYC Portal for Auto Loan Origination - Architecture Plan

## Plan Overview
This document outlines the steps to create a high-level architecture for the KYC Portal based on the requirements and user stories. The architecture will define the system components, their interactions, and key technical decisions.

## Plan Steps

### 1. Requirements and User Stories Analysis
- [ ] Review the requirements document thoroughly
- [ ] Review the user stories document thoroughly
- [ ] Identify key functional areas and capabilities
- [ ] Extract non-functional requirements that impact architecture
- [ ] Identify integration points with external systems
- [x] Clarification needed: Are there any existing systems or infrastructure constraints that the architecture must accommodate? [Answer]: no
- [ ] Design for greenfield implementation without legacy system constraints

### 2. Define Architectural Goals and Principles
- [ ] Define key architectural goals based on requirements
- [ ] Establish architectural principles to guide design decisions
- [ ] Identify quality attributes (performance, security, scalability, etc.)
- [ ] Define technical constraints and assumptions
- [x] Clarification needed: Are there any specific technology preferences or constraints (e.g., cloud provider, programming languages, frameworks)? [Answer]: AWS cloud, python for backend, react for front end. Docker on EKS.
- [ ] Design architecture optimized for AWS cloud infrastructure
- [ ] Plan for Python-based backend services
- [ ] Design for React-based frontend implementation
- [ ] Incorporate containerization using Docker on Amazon EKS

### 3. High-Level System Architecture
- [ ] Define overall architectural style/pattern
- [ ] Create a high-level system context diagram
- [ ] Identify major system components and their responsibilities
- [ ] Define component interactions and dependencies
- [ ] Outline deployment topology
- [x] Clarification needed: What is the expected user load and growth projection for the system? [Answer]: 1000 users per hour.
- [ ] Design architecture to handle 1000 users per hour with room for growth

### 4. Data Architecture
- [ ] Identify key data entities and their relationships
- [ ] Define data storage strategy
- [ ] Design data access patterns
- [ ] Address data security and privacy requirements
- [ ] Define data retention and archiving strategy
- [x] Clarification needed: Are there any specific data sovereignty or compliance requirements that impact where data can be stored? [Answer]: data should stay in India.
- [ ] Design for data residency in India using appropriate AWS regions

### 5. Security Architecture
- [ ] Define authentication and authorization approach
- [ ] Design security controls for data protection
- [ ] Address secure communication requirements
- [ ] Define audit logging and monitoring strategy
- [ ] Outline compliance considerations
- [x] Clarification needed: Are there any specific security standards or certifications that must be met? [Answer]: SEBI RBI guidelines.
- [ ] Incorporate security controls to meet SEBI and RBI guidelines

### 6. Integration Architecture
- [ ] Identify all external system integrations
- [ ] Define integration patterns and protocols
- [ ] Design API strategy
- [ ] Address error handling and resilience
- [x] Clarification needed: What are the details of the SSO integration mentioned in the requirements? [Answer]: We have SSO for login. Will provide details during code gen.
- [ ] Design for SSO integration with placeholder interfaces

### 7. Performance and Scalability
- [ ] Define performance requirements and SLAs
- [ ] Design for scalability based on load requirements
- [ ] Address caching strategy
- [ ] Define monitoring and alerting approach
- [x] Clarification needed: What are the expected peak loads and response time requirements? [Answer]: consistent loads from 9 am IST to 6 PM
- [ ] Design for consistent load patterns during business hours (9 AM to 6 PM IST)

### 8. DevOps and Operational Considerations
- [ ] Define deployment strategy
- [ ] Design for observability (logging, monitoring, tracing)
- [ ] Address backup and disaster recovery
- [ ] Define CI/CD approach
- [x] Clarification needed: What is the expected release cadence and maintenance strategy? [Answer]: once every 2 weeks.
- [ ] Design CI/CD pipeline for bi-weekly release cadence

### 9. Technology Stack Selection
- [ ] Evaluate and select appropriate technologies for each component
- [ ] Justify technology choices based on requirements
- [ ] Address technology risks and mitigations
- [ ] Define technology governance approach
- [x] Clarification needed: Are there any existing technology investments that should be leveraged? [Answer]: SSO for login
- [ ] Incorporate existing SSO solution into the architecture

### 10. Architecture Documentation
- [ ] Create architecture document structure
- [ ] Document architectural decisions and rationales
- [ ] Create component diagrams
- [ ] Document data models
- [ ] Create sequence diagrams for key flows
- [ ] Document API specifications
- [ ] Finalize architecture document

### 11. Architecture Review and Validation
- [ ] Review architecture against requirements
- [ ] Validate architecture against user stories
- [ ] Ensure all non-functional requirements are addressed
- [ ] Identify potential risks and mitigations
- [ ] Prepare for stakeholder review
- [x] Clarification needed: Who will be involved in the architecture review process? [Answer]:me.
- [ ] Prepare architecture review materials for your evaluation

## Next Steps
Once this plan is approved, I will proceed with creating the high-level architecture document based on the approved plan and any clarifications provided.
