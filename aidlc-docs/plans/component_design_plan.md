# KYC Portal for Auto Loan Origination - Component Design Plan

## Plan Overview
This document outlines the steps to create detailed component designs for the key components identified in the architecture document. The component designs will include domain models and API specifications for each component.

## Plan Steps

### 1. Review Architecture and Requirements

- [ ] Define component overview and responsibilities
- [ ] Create domain model for customer-related entities
- [ ] Design API endpoints for customer profile management
- [ ] Design API endpoints for customer search and retrieval

- [x] Clarification needed: What specific customer attributes need to be captured beyond the basic information mentioned in the requirements?

### 5. Design Document Management Service Component
- [ ] Define component overview and responsibilities
- [ ] Create domain model for document-related entities
- [ ] Design API endpoints for document upload and retrieval
- [ ] Design API endpoints for document metadata management
- [ ] Design API endpoints for document lifecycle management
- [ ] Define integration with security scanning services
- [x] Clarification needed: Are there specific document formats or sizes beyond those mentioned in the requirements that need special handling?

### 6. Design Verification Service Component
- [ ] Define component overview and responsibilities
- [ ] Create domain model for verification-related entities
- [ ] Design API endpoints for identity verification
- [ ] Design API endpoints for document verification
- [ ] Design integration with external verification services
- [ ] Define verification result data structures
- [x] Clarification needed: What level of detail is required for the integration with external verification services?

### 7. Design Risk Assessment Service Component
- [ ] Define component overview and responsibilities
- [ ] Create domain model for risk assessment-related entities
- [ ] Design API endpoints for risk scoring
- [ ] Design API endpoints for PEP screening
- [ ] Design API endpoints for enhanced due diligence
- [ ] Define risk scoring algorithms and parameters
- [x] Clarification needed: Are there specific risk scoring models or algorithms that should be incorporated?

### 8. Design Workflow Service Component
- [ ] Define component overview and responsibilities
- [ ] Create domain model for workflow-related entities
- [ ] Design API endpoints for application status management
- [ ] Design API endpoints for task assignment and routing
- [ ] Design API endpoints for decision management
- [ ] Define workflow state transitions
- [x] Clarification needed: How configurable should the workflow engine be? Should it support custom workflow definitions?

### 9. Design Notification Service Component
- [ ] Define component overview and responsibilities
- [ ] Create domain model for notification-related entities
- [ ] Design API endpoints for notification management
- [ ] Design API endpoints for notification preferences
- [ ] Define notification templates and variables
- [ ] Define integration with email and SMS providers
- [x] Clarification needed: Are there specific notification channels beyond email and SMS that need to be supported?

### 10. Design Reporting Service Component
- [ ] Define component overview and responsibilities
- [ ] Create domain model for reporting-related entities
- [ ] Design API endpoints for report generation
- [ ] Design API endpoints for dashboard data
- [ ] Define report templates and parameters
- [ ] Define data aggregation methods
- [x] Clarification needed: What specific reports are required beyond those mentioned in the requirements?

### 11. Define Cross-Component Interactions
- [ ] Document service-to-service communication patterns
- [ ] Define event-driven interactions
- [ ] Document synchronous API calls between services
- [ ] Define error handling and resilience patterns
- [ ] Create sequence diagrams for key workflows
- [x] Clarification needed: Should the component design include detailed sequence diagrams for all major user flows?

### 12. Define Data Consistency Patterns
- [ ] Document data ownership by component
- [ ] Define data synchronization patterns
- [ ] Document eventual consistency strategies
- [ ] Define transaction boundaries
- [ ] Document data validation rules
- [x] Clarification needed: Are there specific data consistency requirements that need special attention?

### 13. Compile Component Design Document
- [ ] Create components.md document structure
- [ ] Organize component designs in a logical order
- [ ] Ensure consistent formatting across all component designs
- [ ] Create cross-reference links between related components
- [ ] Add table of contents for easy navigation
- [x] Clarification needed: Should the component designs be in a single document or separate documents for each component?

### 14. Review and Validation
- [ ] Review component designs against architecture
- [ ] Validate component designs against requirements
- [ ] Ensure all component interactions are properly defined
- [ ] Check for consistency across component designs
- [ ] Identify any gaps or overlaps in component responsibilities
- [x] Clarification needed: Who will be involved in the review process for the component designs?

## Next Steps
Once this plan is approved, I will proceed with creating the detailed component designs based on the approved plan and any clarifications provided.
