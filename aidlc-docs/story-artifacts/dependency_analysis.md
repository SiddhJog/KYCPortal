# KYC Portal for Auto Loan Origination - Dependency Analysis

## Overview
This document identifies and analyzes dependencies between Units of Work (UoW) for the KYC Portal. Understanding these dependencies is crucial for planning the implementation sequence and identifying potential bottlenecks.

## Types of Dependencies
- **Technical Dependency (T)**: One UoW requires technical components or infrastructure from another UoW
- **Functional Dependency (F)**: One UoW requires functionality implemented in another UoW
- **Data Dependency (D)**: One UoW requires data created or managed by another UoW
- **External Dependency (E)**: Dependency on external systems or services

## Critical Path Analysis

Based on the dependency analysis, the critical path for implementation includes:

1. **Foundation Layer**
   - UoW-01: Customer Registration and Authentication
   - UoW-02: Staff Access and Administration

2. **Core Functionality Layer**
   - UoW-03: Document Upload and Management
   - UoW-04: Basic Identity Verification
   - UoW-05: Risk Assessment Framework
   - UoW-06: Application Workflow Management

3. **Essential Features Layer**
   - UoW-07: Customer Communication System
   - UoW-08: Compliance and Regulatory Reporting
   - UoW-13: Performance Optimization

4. **Enhancement Layer**
   - Remaining UoWs can be implemented based on priority and resource availability

## External Dependencies

1. **SSO Integration**
   - Required for UoW-09: Enhanced Security Features
   - Need to coordinate with the organization's identity management team
   - Requires access to SSO provider documentation and test environment
   - May need to register the application with the SSO provider

2. **Aadhaar API Integration (Optional)**
   - Required for UoW-11: Biometric Verification (specifically US-024)
   - Need to apply for API access with appropriate regulatory approvals
   - Requires compliance with UIDAI security and usage guidelines
   - May require specialized hardware for biometric capture

## Implementation Recommendations

1. **Phased Approach**
   - Phase 1: Implement Foundation and Core Functionality Layers (UoW-01 through UoW-06)
   - Phase 2: Implement Essential Features Layer (UoW-07, UoW-08, UoW-13)
   - Phase 3: Implement Enhancement Layer based on priority

2. **Parallel Development Opportunities**
   - UoW-01 and UoW-02 can be developed in parallel
   - UoW-09 can be developed in parallel with other units after UoW-01 and UoW-02 are complete
   - UoW-14 through UoW-16 can be developed in parallel after their dependencies are met

3. **Risk Mitigation**
   - Begin integration discussions for external dependencies early
   - Create mock interfaces for dependent components to enable parallel development
   - Implement feature flags to enable/disable features that depend on external systems
