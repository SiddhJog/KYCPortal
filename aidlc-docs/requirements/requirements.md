# KYC Portal for Auto Loan Origination - Requirements Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the functional and non-functional requirements for a Know Your Customer (KYC) portal specifically designed for auto loan origination. The portal aims to streamline the KYC process, ensuring regulatory compliance while providing an efficient and user-friendly experience.

### 1.2 Background
Financial institutions are required to verify the identity of their customers as part of regulatory compliance. The KYC process for auto loans involves collecting and verifying customer information and documents to prevent fraud, money laundering, and terrorist financing. Currently, these processes may be fragmented across multiple systems or manual workflows, leading to inefficiencies and potential compliance gaps.

### 1.3 Scope
The KYC portal will serve as a comprehensive platform for collecting, verifying, and managing customer information and documentation specifically for auto loan applications. It will support the entire KYC lifecycle from initial customer registration to final approval or rejection.

### 1.4 Business Objectives
- Complete the KYC process within one year of implementation
- Create a single repository for all customer data and documents
- Process approximately 400 applications per day
- Ensure compliance with SEBI and RBI regulations
- Streamline the loan origination process through automation
- Reduce manual verification efforts through AI-powered document and data comparison
