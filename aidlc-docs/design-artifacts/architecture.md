# KYC Portal for Auto Loan Origination - Architecture Document

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document describes the high-level architecture for the KYC Portal for Auto Loan Origination. It outlines the system components, their interactions, and key technical decisions to guide the development team in implementing the system.

### 1.2 Scope
This architecture covers all aspects of the KYC Portal system, including:
- Customer-facing web application
- Staff portal for verification and approval
- Backend services for document processing and verification
- Data storage and management
- Integration with external systems
- Security, performance, and operational considerations

### 1.3 Architectural Goals
Based on the requirements and user stories, the following architectural goals have been established:

1. **Security and Compliance**: Ensure the system meets SEBI and RBI regulatory requirements for KYC processes, with robust security controls for sensitive customer data.

2. **Scalability and Performance**: Support processing of at least 1000 users per hour with response times meeting the specified SLAs (page loads < 200ms, document uploads < 30 seconds).

3. **Modularity and Extensibility**: Design a modular system that allows for independent development and deployment of components, with clear interfaces between them.

4. **Reliability and Availability**: Achieve 99.9% uptime during business hours with robust error handling and recovery mechanisms.

5. **Data Residency**: Ensure all data is stored within India to meet data sovereignty requirements.

6. **Operational Efficiency**: Support bi-weekly release cycles with minimal downtime and comprehensive monitoring.

### 1.4 Architectural Principles

1. **Security by Design**: Security considerations are incorporated at every level of the architecture, not added as an afterthought.

2. **Cloud-Native Design**: Leverage AWS cloud services to maximize scalability, reliability, and operational efficiency.

3. **Microservices-Based Approach**: Decompose the system into independently deployable services based on business capabilities.

4. **API-First Design**: All services expose well-defined APIs to enable loose coupling and flexibility.

5. **Infrastructure as Code**: All infrastructure is defined and managed through code for consistency and repeatability.

6. **Observability**: Design for comprehensive logging, monitoring, and tracing to ensure operational visibility.

7. **Automation**: Automate deployment, testing, and operational tasks to improve reliability and efficiency.

8. **Data Protection**: Implement comprehensive data protection measures including encryption, access controls, and audit logging.
